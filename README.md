# Tic Tac Toe - Championship Edition!

This is an implementation of Noughts and Crosses, but now with a New York background! Amazing! 

This is the only Noughts and Crosses game that ever was made with this New York background. This wild claim is supported by no evidence whatsoever....

Produced by Ivor King, with the input and guidance from the tremendous **GA crew**.

See comments in the code for the meaning of key variables etc.

TASK

Big Goals
Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
Technical Requirements

Your app must:
Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Enjoy...
