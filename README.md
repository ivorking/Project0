# Tic Tac Toe - Championship Edition!

This is an implementation of the classic game Noughts and Crosses, but now with a New York background! Amazing! 

This is the only Noughts and Crosses game that ever was made with this New York background. This wild claim is supported by no evidence whatsoever. 

You'll have to try the game to verify these outrageous claims...

## Technologies

Technologies used in this project:
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* jQuery
* jQuery-confirm
* font-awesome

## Coding challenges

The most challenging component was the Human vs Computer option. This has been implemented with a simple randomising AI. Implementing styled popups for user input posed some initial challenges, but these were overcome resulting in consistent popup styling.

## Development

This was produced input and guidance from staff and colleagues in the **Sydney GA crew**.

## Future features
I'm planning to improve the in-game Human vs Computer AI, and currently looking at ways to implement this.

## Project brief

*Big Goals*  

Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
Craft a README file that explains your app to the world
Technical Requirements

*The app must:*

* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)*
