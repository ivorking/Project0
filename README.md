# Tic Tac Toe - Championship Edition!

This is an implementation of Noughts and Crosses, but now with a blue background! Amazing! This is possibly the only blue Noughts and Crosses game that ever was made. Although it's unlikely. But still, very possible.

Produced by Ivor King, with the input and guidance from the tremendous **GA crew**.

Enjoy...
